# Practical machine learning course project

The goal of project is to build a prediction model for performing of the 
Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), 
throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), 
lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Data 
from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants is used for analysis.
